  Array bounds overflow，runtime verification，program instrumentation

  Buffer overflow can cause very serious security problems and bring serious threats to networks and distributed systems such as clusters, Grids, P2P systems. Array bounds overflow is an important instance of buffer overflow. How to check array bounds overflow is an important and meaningful issue. we present a runtime verification method for checking array bounds overflow. At first, we analyze the various classes of array bounds overflow errors. Based on the classification, we investigate the various verification methods. After that, we study the algorithms for dynamic checking of array bounds overflow based on program instrumentation. We implement the algorithms based on the open source compiler Clang.
